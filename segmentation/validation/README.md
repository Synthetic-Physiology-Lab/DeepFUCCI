# Benchmarking the custom DeepFUCCI networks

This folder contains scripts that were developed to obtain the segmentation accuracy
on various datasets.

The datsets are:

* `CellMAPtracer`: PIP-FUCCI dataset
* `CottonEtAl2024`: intestinal epithelial cells
* `eDetectHaCaTFUCCI`: high SNR HaCaT cells with SMAD reporter
* `TestData`: low SNR HT1080 data
* `ConfluentFUCCI`: confluent cells used for ConfluentFUCCI training
* `DAPI_equivalent`: conventional DAPI equivalent scripts, no data
* `InstanSeg`: only scripts to check InstanSeg performance
* `ValidationData`: scripts to measure performance on validation data set
