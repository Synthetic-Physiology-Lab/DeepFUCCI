# Classification


The sensor can distinguish three cell cycle phases:

1. G1 phase (label **1**)
1. G1/S phase (label **2**)
1. S/G2/M phase (label **3**)

Every nuclear label receives a cell cycle label.
These labels are stored in a JSON file.

Details are described in the `DataPreparation` folder.

## Training

See the scripts in the `training_scripts` folder.
They follow mostly the instructions of the StarDist
repository.
