# Cellpose-SAM for classification

Following the recent Cellpose-SAM preprint, I adapted
the script provided on
[Github](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose/blob/main/paper/cpsam/semantic.py)
so that it worked with our DeepFUCCI data.

## Training

You can run `train_cellpose_sam_classification.py`.
Make sure that the path to the training data directory
is correctly specified at the end of the script.


## Using it
